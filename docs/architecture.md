# Architecture

BFF pattern: `apps/web` never talks to AWS directly. It calls `apps/bff`, which is the only
thing that touches DynamoDB, OAuth providers, and issues sessions.

```
apps/web (Vite/React)  --/api/*-->  CloudFront  --> apps/bff (NestJS, one Lambda)
                                       |                    |
                                       +--> S3 (static)     +--> DynamoDB (Content, Users)
```

One CloudFront distribution serves both: the default behavior serves the built React app
from S3, and `/api/*` is routed to an API Gateway HTTP API in front of the BFF Lambda. This
means the frontend and API share an origin in every environment (no CORS to think about in
prod), and WAF at the CloudFront layer covers both.

## Why these choices

- **Lambda + HTTP API over Fargate/ALB** — scales to zero, no idle cost. At low/unknown
  traffic this stays close to free; an ALB + always-on Fargate task would burn a chunk of
  the $50/mo budget just sitting idle. See [infra.md](infra.md) for the breakdown.
- **Single Lambda for the whole BFF** — NestJS boots once per warm instance and handles all
  routes internally via Fastify. Simpler to reason about than one Lambda per route, and
  cold starts are acceptable at this traffic level.
- **DynamoDB single-table design** — see [data-model.md](data-model.md).
- **In-memory search instead of a managed search service** — the dataset is ~1,000 rows;
  scanning and searching in memory is free and fast at this scale. Revisit if it grows.

## Data flow for a search

1. Browser calls `GET /api/things?q=...&petType=...`.
2. `ThingsController` delegates to `SearchService`, which caches a full table scan (60s TTL)
   and runs a fuzzy search (`fuse.js`) over it in memory.
3. Result is a plain array of `Thing` (see `packages/shared-types`), rendered as
   `ThingCard`s.

## Data flow for a contribution

1. User signs in via GitHub OAuth (`AuthModule`) — see
   [verification-flow.md](verification-flow.md) for why GitHub specifically and how the
   quiz gate works.
2. Verified users `POST /api/contributions`, which writes a pending item under the target
   Thing's partition (or a fresh id for a new Thing) — never directly to the live item.
3. A verified contributor can review the queue at `GET /api/contributions/pending` and
   `POST /api/contributions/:thingId/:sk/approve`, which promotes the payload into a real
   `Thing` item. There's no admin-role check yet — see the note in
   `contributions.controller.ts`.
