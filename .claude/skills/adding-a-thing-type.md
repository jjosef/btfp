Thing types are data, not code — there's no schema migration for adding one.

1. `POST /api/thing-types` with `{ name, description, details? }` (or write directly via
   `ThingTypesService.create` from a script/seed).
2. If it needs quiz/search treatment beyond the defaults, check
   `apps/bff/src/verification/quiz-bank.ts` — the quiz only draws distractors from
   `SAFE_PLANT_NAMES`, so a very different type (e.g. "activity") may need its own
   distractor pool for the quiz to make sense.
3. Update `THING_TYPES` in `data/seed/src/transform.ts` if this type should be part of the
   seed pipeline, and add a transform loop mirroring the existing plant/food/medication
   ones.
4. Add the id to `THING_TYPES` array in `apps/web/src/pages/SubmitPage.tsx` so contributors
   can pick it in the submission form.

No frontend routing changes needed — `ThingCard`, `ThingDetailPage`, and the browse/search
filters are all type-agnostic and read `thingTypeId` generically.
